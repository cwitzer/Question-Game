# Question-Game
Created a fun 10 question game using Python

Basically coded this 98% by myself / knowledge, only help I really needed was to use the import os properly to clear the terminal for every question.
I used the global variable which were handy when adding the scores up and revealing the end score.
Following that I used def functions to store the main code along with while loops and time.sleep() to create depth. 
Really enjoyed creating this game since I've always wanted to make a question game from scratch.
